	        <p style="width: 650px; margin-left: -120px; padding-top: 50px; text-align: left;">My name is Sofie Florczak. I am 25 years old and a multimedia design student from Odense, Denmark.<br> 
        I am also an artist, and my biggest passion is to create all kinds of art. It has been a lifelong hobby which I hope I can turn into a lifelong profession.<br> 
        I have always been very creative, and started drawing when I could hold a pencil.<br> Gradually I began experimenting with different mediums and styles of drawing and painting.<br> I also enjoy photography and discovered the world of digital art, and the endless possibilities of what you can create - this sparked the idea of studying multimedia design.<br> I enjoy making posters, logos, cover-designs, illustrations, even tattoo designs and giving new digital life to old drawings.<br> 
        What gives me joy is to realize and communicate other people’s ideas visually and give them my own twist.<br> I like working with all kinds of subjects, since I am very curious by heart, and always strive to learn new things, which gives fuel to the creative thinking process.<br> I feel most at ease when I am using my hands for drawing or painting physically, but I want to expand my knowledge and skills with digital methods, merging the two together,since modern technology keeps on expanding and is an important part of this era.<br> 
        I’m in the zone when I can ping-pong with other dedicated, creative and skilled people, while at the same time being able to immerse myself in my own work or projects.<br>Through time I've done different commissions for family, friends and friends of friends etc. and it is my dream to one day be able to work freelance with a wide spectrum of projects!</p><br>
